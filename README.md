# CMSC320 Final Project

Our project is focused on the account of Donald Trump and the replies to his tweets. We delved into sentiment analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning to analyze the political climate surrounding Trump on December 9, 2017. Our findings aren't exactly groundbreaking (Trump isn't popular), but the tools and methods we used to reach them are pretty interesting.
