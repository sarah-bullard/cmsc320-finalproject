# cmsc320-finalproject
This project uses Python with Jupyter notebooks to explore the responses to President Trump's tweets on December 9, 2017. We use tweepy, pandas, scikit-learn, pyplot, and the NLTK natural language processing libraries in this project. 

This project involved analyzing tweets to create new features for our data, including the user's presumed political alignment based on the hashtags they have used and the users they follow. We had to deal with issues such as lack of sufficient data and the difficulty of detecting sarcasm in natural language processing. This project was also an exercise in presenting our code and proecess in a clear and replicable manner.
